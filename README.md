Wildlife Conservation: Create an AI-powered system using Google Cloud's AutoML Vision API to monitor and identify endangered species in their natural habitats. Build a platform that connects researchers, conservationists, and citizen scientists to contribute to wildlife preservation efforts.

Monitoring Endangered Species: The app uses cameras and sensors placed in wildlife areas to keep an eye on endangered species. These devices capture pictures or videos of the animals in their natural habitats.

Identifying Endangered Species: The app has a smart system that uses AI to analyze the pictures and videos. It can recognize different endangered species and tell them apart from other animals. This helps conservationists and researchers keep track of how many endangered animals are left and where they are located.

Real-Time Alerts: When the app detects an endangered species, it immediately sends a message or notification to the people who are using the app. This way, they can quickly take action to protect the animals and their habitats from any potential threats or dangers.

Sharing Information: The app also allows people who care about wildlife conservation, like researchers, conservationists, and everyday citizens, to contribute their own observations and pictures of endangered species. This shared information helps build a larger picture of where these animals are found and what challenges they face.

Collaboration and Learning: The app creates a community of people who are passionate about wildlife conservation. They can connect, share their knowledge, and work together to find solutions. By collaborating, they can learn from each other and come up with better ways to protect endangered species.

Raising Awareness: The app serves as an educational tool, providing information about endangered species and their importance. It offers blogs, articles, and interactive content to help people learn more about wildlife conservation. By raising awareness, the app inspires individuals to take action and make a positive impact on preserving endangered species.
